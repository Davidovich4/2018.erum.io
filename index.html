                                <h1>About the Conference</h1>
                            </div>

                            <p>The European R Users Meeting, <a href="http://erum.io">eRum</a>, is an international conference that aims at integrating users of the R language living in Europe. Although the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/conferences.html">useR! conference series</a> also serve similar goals, but as it's alternating between Europe and USA (and more recently Australia in 2018), we decided to start another conference series in the years when the useR! is outside of Europe.</p>

                            <p>The first eRum conference was held in <a href="http://2016.erum.io">2016 in Poznan, Poland</a> with around 250 attendees and 20 sessions spanning over 3 days, including more than 80 speakers. Around that time, we also held another, although shorter conference in Budapest: the <a href="http://budapest.satrdays.org">first satRday event</a> happened with 25 speakers and almost 200 attendees from 19 countries. The eRum 2018 conference brings together the heritage of these two successful events: planning for 400-500 attendees from all around Europe at this 1+2 days international R conference.</p>

                            <p>The local Organizing Committee is lead by Gergely Daroczi, who chaired the Budapest satRday event as well. Just like the satRday series, eRum is also a nonprofit conference and driven by enthusiasm for open-source, R and the related community, so we make no financial gains and we do not get paid at all for working on this event.

                            <p>We also offer "Supporter" level tickets for around 30% extra over the "Industry" ticket prices to express your support for this event and the R community by making it possible for others without the requred financials to attend the event. We suggest this option for freelancers and smaller companies without a budget to become an official <a href="#sponsors">sponsor</a> of the conference. Note, that the "Supporter" level tickets provide the exact same features as any other ticket, the only extra feature is a special-colored badge to highlight your generous contribution.</p>
                            <h5 id="faq-ticket-types">Not sure which conference ticket to buy?</h5>

                                <li>We decided to keep the <i>student ticket</i> fees as low as possible (not even covering our catering and related expenses -- so heavily relying on our <a href="#sponsors">sponsors</a>' generous contributions) and affordable for students even without any salary. Pick this option if you are an actual full-time student <i>without</i> income letting you pick a more expensive ticket type</li>
                                <li>R users working in academia (eg higher education or research institutes etc) should pick the <i>Academic</i> option, which is still very reasonably priced and planned to be affordable for most European researchers, professors and PhD candidates -- hopefully covered by your institute</li>
                                <li>Everyone else with a full-time and paid job (or equivalent, eg freelancing) should pick the <i>Industry</i> option (which is still pretty affordable compared to past years' useR! and other conference ticket prices) -- hopefully sponsored or reimbursed by your employer</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5 id="faq-payment">What payment options are possible?</h5>
                            <p>Please note that by default, we only accept Paypal payments (eg debit or credit cards) to automate the administrative tasks related to ticketing and invoicing to reduce our costs at this nonprofit event and make it affordable for all attendees -- but on request, we can also provide a proforma invoice and accept postpaid wire transfer as well. Please note that this option requires us to charge ~10 EUR extra administration fee. If that's what you rather prefer (or have to do), then go ahead with the registration and pick the "Paper invoice or post-paid option" Invoice Type, fill in all your details, then use the "POSTPAID" Discount Code to check-out without paying via PayPal. Then we will send you the proforma invoice in a week and finalize your registration after the payment has cleared.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, please note that wire-transfer payments are possible via PayPal as well, so if you would like to avoid paying the extra administration fee, you can also open a free PayPal account and do a wire-transfer there to top up your account, then register for the eRum conference using your PayPal balance -- so that's also possible without having access to a debit or credit card.</p>

                            <p>The pesentations of the conference will be delivered in the following formats:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Workshop (3-6 hours)</b>: A hands-on tutorial for 20-100 persons on a beginner or advanced R topic for 180 mins with a 30 mins coffee break between the two 90 mins long sessions in a classroom environment, where attendees work on a laptop. No video or live-stream or video recordings are planned.</li>
                                <li><b>Keynote talk</b>: 45 mins invited, plenary (no parallel sessions) talk followed by 5 mins of Q&A in the main auditorium, potentially live-streamed on the Internet and to the other rooms at the conference venue.</li>
                                <li><b>Invited talk</b>: 18 mins invited talk followed by 2 mins of Q&A in one of the two main auditoriums, potentially live-streamed on the Internet.</li>
                                <li><b>Regular talk</b>: 18 mins contributed talk followed by 2 mins of Q&A in an auditorium, potentially live-streamed on the Internet.</li>
                                <li><b>Lightning talk (5min)</b>: variation of the pecha kucha and ignite formats with fixed number of 15 slides in an auditorium, followed by 1 quick question if time allows. The slides are auto-forwarding every 20 seconds.</li>
                                <li><b>Poster</b>: presenters bring their printed posters not exceeding 4' x 4' or 120cm x 120cm to be mounted on the wall or provided poster holder (with tools provided by the organizers) for 4 hours on the Monday night social event. Attendees can freely walk around in the dedicated Poster Session area to check the posters and chat with the presenters. The presenters are suggested to stand by or not too far from their posters to answer any question others might have and to grab all opportunities to speak about their presentation :) If you want to print your posters in Hungary, you can get it printed eg in CopyGuru.hu for around 25 EUR.</li>
                                <li><b>Demo</b>: 5 mins of freeform presentation in an auditorium on Monday night without any dedicated time for Q&A, but with a follow-up session in a dedicated area (with tables) of the Poster Session where the presenters can continue demoing their application to the interested attendees and answer questions etc.</li>

                                                You’ve got the killer idea for an R package, but you’re not sure where to start? Then you’ve come to the right place!
                                                <br><br>
                                                During this workshop, we’ll go through the whole process of building a package that lasts. In other words, we’ll review the best practices to create a package that works (obviously), but more importantly a package that is extensively tested to prevent bugs, that will be easier to maintain on the long run, and that will be fully documented.
                                                <br><br>
                                                At the end of this workshop, the attendees will have a road map for writing robust packages, designed for industrial use and/or for CRAN.

                                                <h3>Plan of the workshop</h3>

                                                <h4>Detailed Outline</h4>
                                                During the tutorial the participants will perform a guided data analysis task and make several refactoring steps as we progress. They will immediately experience the benefit of applying the shown techniques. The tutorial will cover launguage-agnostic and R-specific topics as well.

                                                <h4>Pre-requisites</h4>
                                                Participants should be able to create simple R functions and use R for data analysis. We believe the tutorial is useful for beginners as well as for more experienced R programmers.
                                                <h4>Justification</h4>
                                                Most R users do not have a formal background in software engineering, however, coding is a significant part of their job. We believe every R user can benefit from writing cleaner and simpler code which also makes it more reusable and less error-prone. Writing clean code also helps with reproducibility. Refactoring early and often makes the life of your future self and your collaborators as well as others wishing to understand your code easier.

                                                <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
                                                Participants should be familiar with for loops, if statements and writing simple functions.
                                                <h3>Justification</h3>
                                                R is now used in many disparate settings. However, the majority of R programmers have no formal computer training, and instead have "learned on the job". This tutorial aims to fill in some of these gaps.

                                                An analysis of CRAN maintainers in 2016 estimated that 11.4% were women <a href="http://forwards.github.io/data/">(http://forwards.github.io/data/)</a>. This proportion is much lower than the proportion of women that attended the R conference useR! in the same year (28%). In addition a survey of the participants at that useR! conference found that women were less likely than men to have experience of contributing to or writing packages <a href="http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/">(http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/</a>. Also women were less likely to use R recreationally, so perhaps have less opportunity to develop package development skills.

                                                This workshop is designed to address this skills gap. It is for women who have done some R coding and are ready to take the next step in providing it to others to use.

                                                The data.table package is a powerful tool for manipulating data, especially if the underlying data set gets large (~ above 1 GB). In spite of its clear advantages the package is underused. Many R users are afraid of it because of its "ugly" syntax. This workshop aims to dismantle this belief by showing the beauty in the package logic, and illustrating its strengths in performance.
                                                <br><br>
                                                By the end of the tutorial participants should be able to:
                                                <br><br>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>use data.table for common data manipulation tasks (data input/output, aggregation, reshaping, joins)</li>
                                                    <li>build on their understanding of data.table syntax to solve more complicated tasks</li>
                                                    <li>compare the performance of the package to other widely used alternatives</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <h3>Method</h3>
                                                The workshop would start with a short introduction into the logic and syntax of the data.table package. The participants would discover the power and beauty of the package through guided data manipulation tasks borrowed mainly from Emarsys use cases.
                                                <h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
                                                Participants should be able to solve data manipulation tasks in R (using base R or the hadleyverse/tidyverse). No knowledge of the data.table package is required.

                                                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is just around the corner. The regulation will become enforceable a week after the eRum conference (from 25 May 2018). Are you and your organization ready to explain your models?
                                                <br><br>
                                                This is a hands-on tutorial for R beginners. I will demonstrate the use of two R packages, h2o &amp; LIME, for automatic and interpretable machine learning. Participants will be able to follow and build regression and classification models quickly with H2O's AutoML. They will then be able to explain the model outcomes with a framework called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME).

                                                Unstructured text data is rapidly increasing in volume and variety and with advances in Machine Learning it’s becoming available to be tapped for insights and patterns. One of the use-cases of predictive modelling in text analytics would be to classify an author based on text alone. However, even the most accurate model may be difficult to interpret and therefore understand how reliable it is or whether it produces insights that can be generalized. One of the solutions here is to apply the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework to the classifiers to generate interpretable explanations.

                                                In this workshop, we will take you step-by-step through tidytext principles and text-analytics pipeline to create a predictive model classifying tweets by Clinton or Trump. We will go over the data collection, exploration, feature engineering and model building. Finally, we will apply the LIME framework to better understand and interpret what drives model predictions.

                                                Complex machine learning models are frequently used in predictive modelling. There are a lot of examples for random forest like or boosting like models in medicine, finance, agriculture etc.
                                                <br><br>
                                                In this workshop we will show why and how one would analyse the structure of the black-box model.
                                                <br><br>
                                                This will be a hands-on workshop with four parts. In each part there will be a short lecture (around 20 minutes) and then time for practice and discussion (around 20 min).
                                                <br><br>
                                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                                Here we will show what problems may arise from blind application of black-box models. Also we will show situations in which the understanding of a model structure leads to model improvements, model stability and larger trust in the model.
                                                <br><br>
                                                During the hands-on part we will fit few complex models (like xgboost, randomForest) with the mlr package and discuss basic diagnostic tools for these models.
                                                <h4>Conditional Explainers</h4>
                                                In this part we will introduce techniques for understanding of marginal/conditional response of a model given a one- two- variables. We will cover PDP (Partial Dependence Plots) and ICE (Individual Conditional Expectations) packages for continuous variables and MPP (Merging Path Plot from factorMerger package) for categorical variables.
                                                <h4>Local Explainers</h4>
                                                In this part we will introduce techniques that explain key factors that drive single model predictions. This covers Break Down plots for linear models (lm / glm) and tree-based models (randomForestExplainer, xgboostExplainer) along with model agnostic approaches implemented in the live package (an extension of the LIME method).
                                                <h4>Global Explainers</h4>
                                                In this part we will introduce tools for global analysis of the black-box model, like variable importance plots, interaction importance plots and tools for model diagnostic.

                                                If you don’t work at one of the big tech giants, then deep learning may seem out of reach. Fortunately, in recent years the barrier to entry has dropped dramatically. Libraries, such as TensorFlow, have made it much easier to implement the low level linear algebra. While Keras builds on this to provide a high level Python API specifically for building neural networks. A single data scientist can now quickly build a deep network, layer by layer, without losing time on implementation details. You don’t need terabytes of data and GPU clusters to get started; even relatively small problems can now benefit from deep learning.
                                                <br><br>
                                                A key aim of Keras is to reduce the time from idea to implementation. Many data scientists choose to use the R language for its first class statistics functionality, powerful data manipulation, and vibrant community. While Python is also a fantastic choice for data science, learning it is a significant investment when what you really want to be doing is trying out your idea. For this reason RStudio created the R Interface to Keras. This allows an R user to quickly experiment with neural networks to see if they are right for their problem.
                                                <br><br>
                                                In this workshop we will get you up and running with Keras for R. We will cover some theoretical background but the focus is on implementation. We will demonstrate how to setup different types of neural network to solve simple problems with time series, and give you the opportunity to build your own with guided exercises.
                                                <br><br>
                                                A cloud based RStudio Server environment will be provided so attendees only require a laptop with internet access and a modern browser. Basic R knowledge is required, and it will help if attendees are familiar with packages such as dplyr for data manipulation.

                                                Geographic data is special and has become ubiquitous. Hence, we need computational power, software and related tools to handle and extract the most interesting patterns of this ever-increasing amount of (geo-)data.
                                                <br><br>
                                                This workshop gives an introduction how to do so using R. It will introduce the audience how the two most important spatial data models - vector and raster - are implemented in R. The workshop will also give an introduction to spatial data visualization.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Maps are a compelling way to display complex data in a beautiful way while allowing first inferences about spatial relationships and patterns.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Additionally, we will bridge R with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), i.e., we show how to combine the best of two worlds: the geoprocessing power of a GIS and the (geo-)statistical data science power of R.
                                                <br><br>
                                                We will do so with a use case presenting spatial and predictive modeling.

                                                <h3>Overview</h3>

                                                In this workshop you will learn how to plot spatial data in R by using the <b>tmap</b> package. This package is an implementation of the grammar of graphics for thematic maps, and resembles the syntax of <b>ggplot2</b>. This package is useful for both <i>exploration</i> and <i>publication</i> of spatial data, and offers both <i>static</i> and <i>interactive</i> plotting.

                                                <br><br>
                                                For those of you who are unfamiliar with spatial data in R, we will briefly introduce the fundamental packages for spatial data, which are <b>sf</b>, <b>sp</b>, and <b>raster</b>. With demonstrations and exercises, you will learn how to process spatial objects from various types (polygons, points, lines, rasters, and simple features), and how to plot them. Feel free to bring your own spatial data.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Besides plotting spatial data, we will also discuss the possibilities of <i>publication</i>. Maps created with <b>tmap</b> can be exported as static images, html files, but they can also be embedded in <b>rmarkdown</b> documents and <b>shiny</b> apps.
                                                <br><br>

                                                One of the biggest challenges for a data analyst is to ensure the reliability of the data since the validity of the conclusions from the analysis hinges on the quality of the input data. This tutorial will cover the workflow of data screening and -validation that transforms raw data into data that can be used for statistical analysis.

                                                In particular, we will discuss organizing research projects, tidy data formats, internal and external validity of data, requirements for reproducible research, the <b>dataMaid</b> R package for customized data screening, the <b>assertr</b> and <b>assertive</b> R packages for data validation and data validation rule sets, and how to produce code books that summarize the final result of the data screening process and provide a starting point for the subsequent statistical analyses.</p>

                                                <h3>Overview</h3>
                                                When people think of graphs, they often think about mapping out social media connections. While graphs are indeed useful for mapping out social networks, they offer so much more. Graphs provide a datastructure that scales very well and can be queried in intuitive ways. Data structures in the real world resemble vertices and edges more than they resemble rows and columns. <b>Gremlin</b> and <b>Cypher</b> are query languages that take advanatage of the natural structure of graph databases. In this tutorial I will show how we can use <b>igraph</b> in a similar manner as these graph query languages to get new insites into our data.

                                            <p>A common challenge in large-scale courses is that many variations of similar exercises are needed for written exams, online tests conducted in learning management systems (such as Moodle, Blackboard, etc.), or live quizzes with voting via smartphones or tablets. The open-source package exams for R (http://www.R-exams.org/) provides a one-for-all approach to automatic exams generation, tying together various open-source packages (in R and beyond). It is based on individual exercises for multiple-choice or single-choice questions, numeric or text answers, or combinations of these. The format can be either in R/LaTeX or R/Markdown containing questions/solutions with some random numbers, text snippets, plots/diagrams, or even individualized datasets. The exercises can be combined to exams and easily rendered into a number of output formats including PDFs for classical written exams (with automatic evaluation), import formats for various learning management systems, live voting (via ARSnova), and the possibility to create custom output (in PDF, HTML, Docx, ...).</p>
                                            <p>It is illustrated how the Department of Statistics at Universität Innsbruck manages its large introductory mathematics course using PDF exams that can be automatically scanned and evaluated, online tests in the OpenOLAT learning management system, and live quizzes in the ARSnova audience response system. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how psychometric item response theory (IRT) can be utilized to gain further insights into the difficulty of the questions, ability of the students, and the "fairness" of the exam across participants.</p>

This talk will describe a general framework to deal with such data, especially focusing on the unsupervised setting and exploratory analyses. Also, solutions for combining multiple relational data - each providing a different view on a specific aspect of the data - will be described. The talk will provide an overview of applications of this framework to self-organizing maps (R package SOMbrero), constrained hierarchical clustering (R package adjclust) and PCA (R package mixKernel), with illustrations on case studies in the fields of biology and social sciences.</p>

Applications range from marketing to election forecasting, well being or happiness analysis, market mood, etc. Despite a huge development of automatic methods, NLP or ontology based algorithms, social media data are not as easy to analyze as one might think compared to the analysis of romance or other forms of digital texts. The reason being the creativity and continuous change of online language. Supervised methods seem to be the only option. We will present some recent theoretical developments and a series of real life applications of these techniques to Twitter and other big data.</p>

Through a partnership with a genealogical site, we have obtained almost a billion 'records'. In the first part of the talk, we will discuss those data, and how to study them, with R. The most difficult tasks is that most tree are ascendant (from children to grand parents), but when studying migration, we must have a descendant approach (from grand parents to children). Furthermore, since we use collaborative data, there are a lot of doublons, and most of them are difficult to track (typos). In the second part, we will discuss semiological aspects : how to visualize complex information, with R.</p>

We will present our unique methodology for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes feature pre-processing and automatic training/tuning of many models, with the goal of maximizing model performance.</p>
                                            <p>H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates the process of training a large selection of candidate models without any user configuration or knowledge about specific machine learning algorithms.  The interface is designed to have as few parameters as possible so that all the user needs to do is point to their dataset, identify the response column and optionally specify a time-constraint.  The user can also specify which model performance metric that they'd like to optimize and use a metric-based stopping criterion for the AutoML process rather than a specific time constraint.  By default, several Stacked Ensembles will be automatically trained on the collection individual models to produce a highly predictive ensemble model which, in most cases, will top the AutoML Leaderboard.</p>
                                            <p>H2O AutoML is available in all H2O interfaces including the h2o R package, Python module and the Flow web GUI.  We will also provide simple R code examples to get you started using H2O AutoML.</p>

                                            <p>In programming, a <i>future</i> is an abstraction for a <i>value</i> that may be available at some point in the future. The non-blocking nature of futures makes them ideal for <i>asynchronous</i> evaluation of expressions in R, e.g. in parallel on the local machine, on a set of remote machines, or in the cloud.</p>
                                            <p>I am presenting the simple, unified, cross-platform future ecosystem for parallel and distributed processing in R. The most fundamental construct is <code>f <- future({ expression })</code> for evaluating the expression asynchronously and later in the program retrieve the value using <code>v <- value(f)</code>. How and when futures are resolved depends is specified by <code>plan()</code> without further modification of the R code. Higher level map-reduce constructs exists, e.g. <code>future_lapply()</code>, and doFuture backends for <code>foreach()</code>. The future framework, available on CRAN, has been used in production for several years.</p>

For reasons of quality control and efficiency it is imperative to be able to understand the effect of each step on the final result.

                                            <p>The lumberjack package offers an elegant solution by endowing the function composition (pipe) operator with the capability of logging changes in data flowing through it. This means that the effect of any data processing function that adheres to the 'tidy' data-in-data-out style can be monitored almost effortlessly. The package offers several basic loggers as well as a framework for users and package authors to refine logging by defining their own loggers.</p>
                                            <p>In this talk I will go into the design principles behind the package, demonstrate the workflow, and show several examples of loggers that usefully summarize changes in data.</p>

In other words, for compositional data the relevant information is contained in the (log-)ratios between the components (parts). Compositional data are present in almost any field of research. Examples for compositional data are, for example, concentration of chemical elements in soil samples, time budget data, expenditures, tax or wage components or percentages and ratios reported in various tables.</p>
                                            <p>Through data from our favourite drinks, we will show the usefulness of the representation of data in isometric coordinates and the analysis of these coordinates instead of analysing the raw data on the simplex. As a side note of the talk, we want to answer such important questions of life: will the quality of beer mainly depend on age and how it should be stored? Should you drink blended coffee, or is Scottish Whisky really different to Irish or American Whiskey? We use the package *robCompositions* for all practical examples.</p>

                                            <p>There is no need to praise Shiny for its influence on results presentation. It’s no longer only a tool internally used by data science teams. Currently it’s becoming an alternative for business and is replacing both the BI solutions and custom made web applications. In order to face the competition, it needs constant development and new features. As with many other technology stacks, Shiny could benefit from community contributions for further development of the packages themselves and growth of independent libraries.</p>
                                            <p>In this presentation we will talk about four novel packages that add interesting capabilities to Shiny such as beautiful UI <code>shiny.semantic</code>, <code>semantic.dashboard</code>, routing <code>shiny.router</code>, and internationalization <code>shiny.i18n</code>. All four packages have been developed to meet the needs that had to be addressed in business projects. This indisputably shows the gaps in the current Shiny capabilities that these packages fill. </p>
                                            <p>During the development process of the packages we took inspiration from proven frontend frameworks such as Meteor or Django.</p>
                                            <p>We will demo these packages and show how their development adds to the open source community, thereby helping companies adopt R/Shiny.</p>

                                            <p>The rise of data science has brought with it a high demand for data scientists. More companies than ever before are looking for the broad skillset of THE data scientist –or the ever out of reach unicorn-- but in reality, most data scientists are moving to the field from diverse backgrounds such as statistics, physics, chemistry, engineering and computer science. So, how does a company ensure their data science team has the right mix of skills to achieve their business goals? Ensuring the statistician has the software engineering skills they need and the computer scientist can understand advanced analytics are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

                                            <p>At Mango, we have been working with a number of companies, across different industries, to help them build their in-house data science capability - from completely new teams to teams already in place, looking to understand how to do data science in practice.</p>

                                            <p>So how do we build on the skills teams with diverse backgrounds already have? How can we use the capability of R to grow strong data science teams? In this talk we will discuss some of the approaches that we have taken at Mango to educate teams in everything from software development best practices to the intricacies of machine learning – all without leaving R!</p>

                                            <p>The development through the tests is a well-established methodology in the field of software engineering for several reasons:</p>

                                            <p>First of all, it validates the real functionality of what we are developing, and avoid regressions in the code functionality: in fact, the automatic tests are run frequently and every time that a new portion of code is added, they check that everything is still working as expected (and eventually point out where it's not going so) Secondly, tested code enables refactoring: it means that using tests you can modify the working code to improve its readability or abstraction without adding further functionality. This provides the re-usability of that code. Furthermore tests describe the code: clearly written tests in fact provide a working documentation of the low-level functionalities of the code being written Finally, Test Driven Development is a programming methodology that starts with the tests to describe the design of the code before it validates its functionality.</p>

                                            <p>However, this methodology has not yet established itself in the world of data science, even if RStudio and several others have already created tools for supporting the package development with automatic tests. Since validating code and making refactoring are very important qualities in data science, I would like to show within this talk how to use tests in the development of a data science project and what are the great advantages that it can lead, in term of clarity of the code, robustness and safeness of code changings.</p>

                                            <p>Plant protection products (PPP) including fungicides, herbicides and insecticides are amongst other factors an important stressor in aquatic ecosystems. We analyzed their seasonal occurrence patterns and possible related adverse effects on aquatic organisms in small running waters. Therefore more than 450.000 water chemistry samples had been collected by German federal agencies between 2005 and 2015. The data were processed in R, mostly by using the data.table-package, before they were uploaded into a relational PostgreSQL data base. For subsequent analysis of seasonal occurrence patterns of PPP in streams we used Generalized Additive Models (GAM) from the mgcv package.</p>

                                            <p>We hypothesized (i) to find increased in-stream occurrences of PPP during months of increased application. Likewise we hypothesized (ii) adverse effects on aquatic organisms to peak during, or shortly after periods of application. Furthermore we hypothesized (iii) to find a long-term decrease in occurrences of compounds, whose authorization has expired during or shortly before the monitoring period.</p>

                                            <p>We defined the occurrence of PPP as the number of detections per compound per month and sampling site. In order to quantify adverse effects of single PPP on different aquatic organism groups Toxic Unit (TU) metrics were used. They are calculated by dividing in-stream compound concentrations by endpoints of experimental toxicity tests. Such test data were obtained through large publicly accessible data bases. Additional data on chemicals were collected using the webchem package and data on organisms were accessed through the taxize package.</p>

                                            <p>We were able to trace seasonal patterns of PPP in small streams and draw conclusions on the effect on aquatic communities therein. With the help of the mentioned R packages and data base systems we were able to establish fast and reproducible procedures for the analysis of large environmental data sets.</p>

You can easily construct scalable data pipelines, train models, evaluate training runs, and deploy your models to a variety of platforms. Until recently these tools were Python centric, but using new R packages (provided by RStudio and available from CRAN), any R programmer can now easily use TensorFlow.</p>

Markov-switching GARCH models have become popular methods to account for regime changes in the conditional variance dynamics of time series. The package MSGARCH allows the user to perform simulations as well as Maximum Likelihood and MCMC/Bayesian estimations of a very large class of Markov-switching GARCH-type models. The package also provides methods to make single-step and multi-step ahead forecasts of the complete conditional density of the variable of interest. Risk management tools to estimate conditional volatility, Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall are also available. We illustrate the broad functionality of the MSGARCH package using exchange rate and stock market return data.</p>

                                            <p>Suppose you develop a graphical user interface which allows the user to create interactive, multi-facetted and/or multi-page charts which visualize the results of arbitrary statistical analyses. To create the charts, you query the data from a database, perform statistical computation on it, repeat it for several data chunks, and plot the results. Suppose the main performance bottleneck is the download of data. Also suppose that the user can modify the parameters of a chart several times before actually requesting the final plot. Welcome to the world of <em>radii.defer</em>, an <strong>R</strong> package by which you can create a nested chain of arbitrary (unevaluated) <strong>R</strong> functions. A <em>Defer</em> object contains a function and its arguments, and a caching scheme. The arguments of a <em>Defer</em> function may be not only standard <strong>R</strong> objects but other (usually unevaluated) <em>Defer</em> objects as well, and the arguments can be updated whenever you wish. When a <em>Defer</em> object is executed, it does not execute any of its <em>Defer</em> arguments unless it is absolutely necessary. Furthemore, <em>radii.defer</em> plays well with the <em>future</em> package allowing asynchronous execution which does not block the main <strong>R</strong> thread. In the talk we will present the main features of the package, and as an example, we will illustrate its use in a complex, cloud-based <em>Shiny</em> application which motivated the development of the package.</p>

                                            <p>The <code>recipes</code> package (Kuhn and Wickham, 2018) is a set of “Preprocessing Tools to Create Design Matrices”. It delivers a framework in which preprocessing steps on one or more variables are captured in individual objects, called <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code>. The former do transformations on variables, the latter assert that expectations about the variables are met. A <code>recipe</code> object is created on a train set, to which the <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code> are added one by one. Once the recipe is done, the <code>prep</code> method is used to estimate all the relevant statistics from the variables. Finally, the actual transformations are applied to data sets using the <code>bake</code> function on the recipe. New data, such as test sets or future observations to score, also run through the recipe via bake. This ensures that the exact same preparation is used on all data sets.</p>

                                            <p>To leverage <code>recipes</code> fully, one should add their own <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code> to the ones that are shipped with the package. However, whereas the use of the package is intuitive and quick to pick up, writing custom <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code> requires some understanding of the package inner workings. In this talk I will give a quick introduction to the package and I will elaborate on how to create your own <code>steps</code> and <code>checks</code>. Providing a framework, or if you like a recipe, for them. After attending this talk you should be able to create your own steps and checks.</p>

                                            <p>Next generation sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, generate tens of millions of reads to quantify the expression levels of the features of interest. A wide number and variety of software packages have been developed for accommodating the needs of the researchers, mostly in the R/Bioconductor framework. Many of these focus on the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes (<code>DESeq2</code>, <code>edgeR</code>, ) to discover quantitative changes between experimental groups, while other address alternative splicing, discovery of novel transcripts, or RNA editing. Moreover, Exploratory Data Analysis is a common step to all these workflows, and despite its importance for generating highly reliable results, it is often neglected, as many of the steps involved might require a considerable proficiency of the user in the programming languages. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used often to obtain a dimension-reduced overview of the data.</p>

                                            <p>Our proposal addresses the two steps of Exploratory Data Analysis and Differential Expression analysis with two different Bioconductor packages, <code>pcaExplorer</code> and <code>ideal</code>. We developed web applications in the Shiny framework also including support for reproducible analyses, thanks to an embedded text editor and a template report, to seamlessly generate HTML documents as a result of the user’s exploration.</p>

                                            <p>Mixed-effect models are commonly used when data consist of clusters of observations. If the model is nonlinear in the parameters, nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models are considered. Growth or shrinkage data where the change trajectory is nonlinear is a common type of data modeled with NLME models, with the subject treated as a cluster and the repeated measurements as the individual observations nested within the cluster. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide a natural framework to describe dynamic systems but sometimes they accept closed-form solutions.</p>

                                            <p>In the recent years, a number of R packages have been created to fit NLME models using various approaches. These are the <em>nlme</em> (Pinheiro et al. 2017), <em>saemix</em> (Comets et al. 2017), <em>nlmixr</em> (Wang et al. 2017), and <em>brms</em> (Buerkner et al. 2016) packages; .each of them has its own specificities. In this talk, we compare the features (algorithms, grammar, documentation, examples), advantages (predictions, embedded model diagnostic tools), and limitations (scope, computational time, dependencies and other constraints) of these 4 solutions.</p>

                                            <p>To illustrate this analysis, we consider two examples taking from the pharmaceutical industry. The first one is a real case of pharmacokinetic data measured in a small number of subjects (N&lt;40), followed up for a long period of time with a rich sampling scheme (more than 8 assessment time points). The second one is a real case of longitudinal tumor size data measured in a large number of solid cancer patients (N&gt;100), followed up for a short period of time (with a median of 4 assessment time points).</p>

                                            <p>Wikidata, one of the most prominent Wikimedia projects nowadays, presents a formal ontology that adheres to the RDF standard. All Wikimedia projects (Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikivoyage, Wikimedia commons, etc) can reach out to and make use of Wikidata by relying on the features of MediaWiki and Wikibase. Currently, more than 800 Wikimedia websites - some of which are found among the most dynamic places online at all - maintain a client-side Wikidata usage tracking. The resulting data sets present a challenging Big Data problem that calls for SQL transfers to Hadoop via Apache Sqoop, massive HiveQL ETL operations and data wrangling in R just in order to enable for the tracking and analytics of individual Wikidata item usage statistics across the Wikimedia projects.</p>

                                            <p>The Wikidata Concepts Monitor (WDCM) system was developed in R to orchestrate various technologies (SPARQL to access Wikidata, SQL, Apache Sqoop, Hive, and Spark) in order to provide for Wikidata usage tracking and analytics. The WDCM then takes a step beyond and performs machine learning (LDA, t-SNE) across the matrices that encompass Wikidata items and Wikimedia projects in order to gain insight into the distributive semantics (i.e. topic models, dimensionality reduction for similarity maps) of Wikidata usage. The system encompasses a set of Shiny dashboards where the results of the WDCM statistical machinery are visualized and tools for analytical work provided in order to help the understanding of the utterly complex social and behavioral phenomenon of Wikidata usage.</p>

                                            <p>Given a set of rankings, for example the finishing orders in a set of races or consumer preferences from market research, we are often interested in estimating the underlying worth of the items being ranked. A well-established approach is to fit a Plackett-Luce model, jointly attributed to Plackett (1975) and Luce (1959).</p>

                                            <p>This talk introduces a new package, <strong>PlackettLuce</strong>, for fitting the Plackett-Luce model to rankings data. In contrast to some of the other packages or approaches to fitting the model in R, <strong>PlackettLuce</strong> can efficiently handle all of the following:</p>

                                            <ul>

                                                <li>ties in the rankings;</li>

                                                <li>rankings of only a subset items;</li>

                                                <li>clustered rankings (rankings for distinct sets of items), and</li>

                                                <li>one or more items that are always ranked first or last in their rankings.</li>

                                            </ul>

                                            <p><strong>PlackettLuce</strong> also enables inference on the worth estimates by providing model-based standard errors and a method for obtaining quasi-standard errors, which don't depend on the identifiability constraints.</p>

                                            <p>Another key feature of the package is a method for fitting Plackett-Luce trees, which will be illustrated in a novel application to identify growing conditions for which trial varieties of bean plants have significantly different worth values.</p>

Most R users probably also had an experience where they got unexpected results which would have been easier to understand with a foundation in object-oriented systems in R. This talk aims to fill some of the gaps so that you can work confidently with existing code utilizing S3 or S4.</p>

The lack of any form of political regulation and their market far from being “efficient”, requires new forms of regulation in the near future. In this paper we study the predictability of cryptocurrencies time–series. We perform a Dynamic Model Averaging analysis using many predictors leading us to more than 31 millions of Dynamic Linear Models estimated at each point in time during the forecast horizon. The whole analysis and the associated huge computational complexity relies on the eDMA package of Catania and Nonejad [2017, Journal Statistical Software, (in press)] available in the R environment. Results are reported for the four most representative coins and indicate different levels of predictability depending on: i) the time period, ii) forecast horizon, iii) and type of coin. A Portfolio optimization application shows that trading strategies which incorporate cryptocurrencies are profitable even after the inclusion of transaction costs.</p>

                                            <p>Subscriptions are no longer just for newspapers. The consumer product landscape, particularly among e-commerce firms, includes a bevy of subscription-based business models. Internet and mobile phone subscriptions are now commonplace and joining the ranks are dietary supplements, meals, clothing, cosmetics and personal grooming products.</p>

                                            <p>Standard metrics to diagnose a healthy consumer-brand relationship typically include customer purchase frequency and ultimately, retention of the customer demonstrated by regular purchases.

                                            <p>The churn diagnosis, however, becomes more complicated for subscription-based products, many of which offer multiple delivery frequencies and the ability to pause a subscription. Brands with subscription-based products need to have some reliable measure of churn propensity so they can further isolate the factors that lead to churn and preemptively identify at-risk customers.</p>

                                            <p>During the presentation I’ll show how to analyze churn propensity for products with multiple states, such as different subscription cadences or a paused subscription. If the time allows I’ll also present useful plots that provide deep insights during such modeling, that we have developed at Gradient Metrics - a quantitative marketing agency (http://gradientmetrics.com/).</p>

                                            <p>Shiny is a popular web application framework that allows to quickly build analytical dashboards using only R. It has many great built-in features that address the needs of most of users. But, what if you need to go beyond that and build custom solutions packed with features that are not available straight away? How far can you push Shiny without breaking it?</p>

                                            <p>It turns out that quite far. In the Exploratory Data Science team at Pearson, we use Shiny to create self-serve analytical tools for internal clients. While we create these tools based on initial requirements, we often need to be able to add additional features as the tool matures. This forces us to think outside the box about how we can build upon the framework offered by Shiny.</p>

                                            <p>In this talk, we’ll present our most complex Shiny app yet. We’ll talk about the process we went through while building it, from prototyping through development, user testing, and deployment. We will cover advanced features of Shiny (e.g. a modularised application structure), communication between Shiny server and JavaScript, as well as sophisticated UI solutions (e.g. click drilldowns, interactive tutorials and custom welcome screens). Most importantly, we will cover what we have learned through rounds of usability testing that entirely changed our approach to data application design.</p>

                                            <p>Statistical data analysis on stream networks needs to take into account the spatial correlation of measurements sampled at connected stream sites. The <em>SSN</em> package for Spatial Statistical Modeling on Stream Networks provides tools to fit glms with spatial autocorrelation. However, so far the tool ‘STARS’ provided for GIS data preparation is based on the commercial software ArcGIS. <em>openSTARS</em> offers an alternative in <strong>R</strong> based on open source GRASS GIS and R packages for spatial data. Thereby it merges the whole work flow of data preparation and statistical analysis on stream networks in one software. <em>openSTARS</em> provides functions to derive stream networks from a digital elevation model, detect and correct non-dichotomous junctions, which cannot be handled by <em>SSN</em>, derive stream catchments and intersect them with land use or other GIS data as potential explanatory variables. Additionally, locations for model predictions can be generated along the stream network. We exemplify the application of <em>openSTARS</em> for water quality monitoring data.</p>

This talk will focus on the paradigm I embrace, and the tools I build on top of the tidyverse packages, to combat this tendency.</p>

                                            <p>At WUZZUF, we provide online career services including job boards, applicant tracking systems, and assessments. I’ll talk about a situation where we observed a low supply of talent for senior software developers jobs, outlining my approach to testing hypotheses about the root causes of the supply/demand imbalance. Rather than reacting to the problem by looking at high-level metrics and jumping to conclusions about the root causes <em>(seen as an acquisition issue by marketers or a recommendation issue by engineers)</em>, I started a deeper analysis, oriented by job hunting and hiring as human experiences.</p>

                                            <p>The tidyverse tools enabled me to see the stories of individuals while maintaining context through the patterns of groups. I’ll highlight how combining <code>tidyr</code>, <code>purrr</code>, list columns, and 'shiny' let me go beyond the preliminary assumptions and reveal deeper issues. At the end, this led to actionable insights regarding our search/recommendation, talent acquisition and job postings.</p>

                                            <p>Although it has academic origins, R is now widely used for many real-world applications including finance, epidemiology, store location analysis and conservation. Indications suggest that the language continues to gain adoption in other areas due to its advantages of cost, reproducibility and flexibility over proprietary products. This talk will explore the potential uptake of R for transport planning, a domain in which powerful yet accessible scriptable languages have much to offer. Transport planning relies on data analysis, a range of spatial and temporal data forms, and visualisation, areas that R excels in, especially with add-on packages such as <strong>sf</strong>. To illustrate the point the talk will describe work commissioned by the UK's Department for Transport to develop a Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT). The PCT is now being used around England to help design strategic cycle networks and improve the effectiveness of precious public investment in transport infrastructure (Lovelace et al. 2017). Based on the experience developing the PCT we will discuss the limitations of R as a tool for transport planning, and the potential of recent developments in packages such as <strong>stplanr</strong> and <strong>dodgr</strong> packages to address them (Lovelace and Ellison, under review). The talk will conclude by outlining reasons for transport planning authorities to demand the use of open source software and reproducibility to ensure democratic accountability and the cost-effective use of public funds.</p>

                                            <p>Current datasets often contain many variables. To cope with this, sparse regression methods have been developed to obtain more interpretable and better performing models than their classical counterparts. Standard regularization methods such as the Lasso or Elastic Net are already implemented in <em>R</em> to obtain sparse GLM results. However, variables often have different structural properties demanding different regularization techniques to obtain logical results. We propose a multi-type Lasso approach to solve this problem, where coefficients of different variables can be regularized by different penalties. Our proposed estimation procedure uses the theory of proximal to split the objective function into smaller subproblems. Each of these subproblems will only contain one penalty such that existing algorithms can be applied. We show how this setup is implemented in <em>R</em> and how different tools and packages work together to get the most out of our approach. The setup is being implemented in an <em>R</em> package where bottleneck calculations happen in <em>C++</em> through the <em>Rcpp</em> API.</p>

                                            <p>A newly emerging field in statistics is distributional regression, where not only the mean but each parameter of a response distribution can be modeled using a set of predictors (Klein et al., 2015). Notable frameworks called Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape and Bayesian Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape were introduced by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2001) in the form of a frequentist perspective and Umlauf, Klein, and Zeileis (2017) using a Bayesian approach, respectively. In distributional regression models, the interpretation of covariate effects on response moments and the expected conditional response distribution is more difficult than with traditional methods such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or Generalized Linear Models (GLM) since the moments of a distribution often do not directly equate the modeled parameters but are rather a combination of them with a varying degree of complexity. This talk will introduce a framework for the visualization of distributional regression models fitted using the bamlss R package (Umlauf et al., 2017) as well as feature an implementation as an R extension titled bamlss.vis. The main goals of this framework are the abilities to: 1. See and compare the expected distribution for chosen sets of covariates 2. View the direct relationship between moments of the response distribution and a chosen explanatory variable, given a set of covariates. Additionally, the user can obtain the code which created the visualizations described above to potentially reproduce them later.</p>

                                            <p>The area-characteristic, maximum possible earthquake magnitude is required by the earthquake engineering community, disaster management agencies and the insurance industry. The Gutenberg-Richter law predicts that earthquake magnitudes follow a truncated exponential distribution. In the geophysical literature several parametric and non-parametric estimation procedures were proposed. Estimation of the maximum possible earthquake magnitude is of course an extreme value problem to which classical methods for endpoint estimation could be applied. However, recent extreme value theory (EVT) methods for truncated tails at high levels constitute a more appropriate setting for this estimation problem. In this talk, we use the methods from the extreme value and geophysical literature to estimate the maximum possible magnitude of earthquakes induced by gas extraction in the Groningen province of the Netherlands. Moreover, a <strong>Shiny</strong> application has been developed (https://treynkens.shinyapps.io/Groningen_app/) to let users perform the analysis where they can e.g. change the considered time period.</p>

                                            <p>All considered EVT-based endpoint estimators are implemented in the <strong>ReIns</strong> package which complements the book &quot;Reinsurance: actuarial and statistical aspects&quot;. In addition to EVT tools to deal with truncated data, <strong>ReIns</strong> provides implementations of classical EVT plots and estimators, and EVT methods that handle censored data.</p>

                                            <p>We describe a framework to use Random Forest to generate spatial and spatiotemporal predictions i.e. as an alternative to model-based geostatistics. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is sub-optimal. To account for this, we use Random Forest (as implemented in the ranger package) in combination with geographical distances to sampling locations to fit models and predict values. We describe eight typical situations of interest to spatial prediction applications: (1) prediction of 2D continuous variable without any covariates, (2) prediction of 2D variable with covariates, (3) prediction of binomial variable, (4) prediction of categorical variable, (5) prediction of variables with extreme values, (6) weighted regression, (7) predictions of multivariate problems, and (8) prediction of spatiotemporal variable. Our results indicate that RFsp can produce comparable results to model-based geostatistics. The advantage of RFsp over model-based geostatistics is that RFsp requires much less statistical assumptions and is easier to automate (and scale up through parallelization). On the other hand, computational intensity of RFsp can blow up as the number of training points and covariates increases. RFsp is still an experimental method and application with large data sets (&gt;&gt;200 spatial locations) is probably not recommended.

                            <p>The workshop day will take place at the <a href="https://www.ceu.edu">Central European University</a> (see the "computer" icon on the map). This new building offers plenty of rooms for the tutorials -- ranging from small seminar rooms with 25 seats up to the big auditorium with up to 400 participants.</p>

                            <p>The second and third days of the conference will take place in the <a href="http://en.akvariumklub.hu/about-the-club">Akvarium Klub</a> (see the "folks" icon on the map), a few minutes walk from the workshops, located only a few hundred meters from the riverside of Danube, and right in the middle of the city center. This venue features a large concert hall with nearly 1300-capacity, a smaller hall, a bar, and a restaurant with unique atmosphere under a pool. In short, we'll have the perfect place for 2 or up to 3 parallel sessions and networking!</p>

                            <h3>Weather forecast</h3>
                            <p>May is a very beautiful month in Hungary, when the daily temperature rises above 20°C, but stays below the summer heat-wave. Late nights can be a bit chilly (make sure to bring a sweater!), but the temperature stays above 10°C. Rain is also not unexpected in this time of the year, but it should be fine. For the most recent forecast, click <a href="http://www.foreca.com/Hungary/Budapest">here</a>.</p>

                            <h3>Parking</h3>
                            <p>There's paid <a href="http://www.erzsebet-parkolo.hu/index.php/en/">parking garage</a> right under the conference venue, for around 2 EUR per hour. Street parking is a bit cheaper: around 1.5 EUR per hour between 8am and 6pm, but there is a 3 hour restriction, so you have to move your car (?) and get a new ticket pretty frequently. On the other hand, Budapest has a dense network of public transport lines (even at night), so you might consider leaving your car behind (maybe at a free P+R spot) and taking the metro/underground instead. Sporty visitors may choose the <a href="http://molbubi.bkk.hu/">BUBI</a>, the public bike-sharing system.</p>

                            <h3>Smoking policy</h3>
                            <p>Smoking is banned in all enclosed public places, on public transport, and in all worplaces in Hungary. Regarding the conference venues, there will be a dedicated smoking area outside the building.</p>

                            <h3>Alcohol policy</h3>
                            <p>Entering the conference venue with any open or visible alcohol container is strictly prohibited. The consumption of alcoholic beverages is forbidden in the conference building except for beverages served as part of the official catering.</p>

                            <h3>Harassment policy</h3>
                            <p>This conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language or imagery is not appropriate for talks, exhibitors’ displays, or social and dining events. Violators may be sanctioned, including being expelled from the conference without a refund, at the complete discretion of the Conference Organizing Committee.</p>

                            <h2>Workshops</h2>
                            <p>Attendees are highly suggested to bring their own laptops, as no on-site computers will be available. Although we try to provide enough power outlets, but cannot guarantee that everyone will be able to charge all the computers at the same time, so we advise to bring a fully-charged laptop and share the power outlets with others.</p>
                            <p>Public WiFi will be available to all attendees with reasonable speed. Please note that only HTTP(S) traffic is allowed, so eg you cannot SSH to remote servers -- except using your own VPN network.</p>
                            <h2>Conference days</h2>
                            <p>Public WiFi will be available, although don't expect blazing fast connection -- this is a concert hall, so probably better to fall back to mobile broadband access if possible. Please note that only HTTP(S) traffic is allowed on the public WiFi, so eg you cannot SSH to remote servers -- except using your own VPN network.</p>
                            <p>Attendees can bring their own laptops, but please note that only limited number of power outlets will be provided in the concert halls -- so we advise to bring a fully-charged laptop and share the power outlets with others. Some tables in a separated silent area will be provided for those who would like to charge the laptops/phones while working from the conference venue.</p>
                            <h2>For Speakers</h2>
                            <p>Please note the above mentioned limitations on the public WiFi.</p>
                            <p>Presenters of workshops are advised that each workhop room is equipped with a large LCD screen or projector with HD resolution and HDMI connector. Presenters must bring their own laptops. Technical help will be available on-site on request. We suggest to arrive early to the venue (eg no later than 30 mins before your session) to make sure that everything is working as expected and ready for the workhop.</p>
                            <p>Speakers on the conference days are encouraged to bring a copy of the presentation in PDF format on a USB stick and to use the provided Mac for the presentation. If you may need to use your own computer for the presentation (eg for a live demo on a custom environment), it's possible to proxy the screen of your computer to the Mac via HDMI output. An IT/AV technician and conference assistants will be available on-site to help with any technical questions. Please see your session chair before the start of your session and check that your presentation works fine with the provided infrastructre.</p>
